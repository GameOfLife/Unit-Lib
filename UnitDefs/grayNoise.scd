/*
\grayNoise

Generates noise which results from flipping random bits in a word. This type of noise has a high RMS level relative to its peak to peak level. The spectrum is emphasized towards lower frequencies.

amp: amplitude (0-1) of the noise
seed: random seed (positive whole number). The same seed will always result in exactly the same noise on any computer. If you want decorrelated noise from multiple sources, change the seed on each source to a different number.
