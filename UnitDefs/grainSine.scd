/*
\grainSine

A granular synthesis generator. This will play tiny segments ("grains") of sine waves with optional random dispersion and distribution.

range: the minimum and maximum frequency in between which each grain is randomly chosen
pos: range of position in the file between 0 (start) and 1 (end)
density: the average number of grains per second
timeVar: time variation factor (0-4). 0 means no variation, 4 means times between grains can be within (1/4) and 4 times the original duration
overlap: average number of overlapping grains. The duration of the grains is change to match this.
pan: the pan position range. This is only active if numChannels > 1
amp: the overall amplitude of the generator
seed: random seed
numChannels: number of output channels
