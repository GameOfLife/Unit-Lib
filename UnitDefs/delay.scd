/*
\delay

time: the length of the delay.
timeScale: the number of seconds by which 'time' is multiplied. This value can not be changed during playback.
dry: level of the dry signal.
amp: level of the delayed signal.
lag: smoothing time applied to change of delay time, use to prevent clicks during change of delay time.
