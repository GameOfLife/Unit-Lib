/*
\rmsCompressor

An rms-compressor. The mean value is taken over a range of 40 samples.

thresh: in dB.
ratio: ratio of the reduced level to the original level.
knee: the size of the knee in dB over and under the threshold. 0 is equal to no knee.
att: attack. The time it takes to follow an attack.
rel: release. The time it takes to follow a decay.
makeUp: make-up gain.
