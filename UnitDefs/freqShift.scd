\freqShift

freqShift implements single sideband amplitude modulation, also known as frequency shifting, but not to be confused with pitch shifting. Frequency shifting moves all the components of a signal by a fixed amount but does not preserve the original harmonic relationships.

freq: the amount of shifting (Hz)
phase: phase of the freq shift (radians)
