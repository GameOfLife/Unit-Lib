/*
\ringz

Creates an UMap that routes an input value through a ringing filter with attack and decay and adds the result to the original value. This causes oscillations to happen at value changes.

value: the value upon which the lag is applied (this can be another UMap as well)
freq: the frequency of the filter. Rapid changes of this value may cause the filter to be temporarily unstable
attackTime: the attack time of the
decayTime: the decay time of the ringing filter
amp: amplitude of the ringing filter

The value arg range is mapped to that of the parameter to which the UMap is connected.
