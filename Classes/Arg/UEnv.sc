/*
UEnv automatically creates a standard envelope for a U (unit).

It creates the following private controls automatically:

	u_gate (1) : a gate to release the envelope
	u_dur (inf) : a duration (s) for the unit, may be inf (default)
	u_doneAction (0) : a doneAction for when the envelope is released or finished
	                   this may release the unit itself (2) or the whole UChain (14)
	u_gain (0) : overall gain in dB (0 == no change, -inf = silent)
	u_fadeIn (0) : fade in time (s)
	u_fadeOut (0) : fade out time (s), within the duration or after the release

An UEnv is typically applied once in a unit that has output(s) to the hardware buses.
In UChains it is used internally for releasing, gain and setting the overal level.
Units containing a UEnv are usually found at the tail of a UChain, and UChains should
contain at least one unit with a UEnv (otherwise they have no control over fade times, 
duration etc.).
